# website
Website I made to test out my skills 

When I found out that we would be making websites in our Computer Science course, I created this demo website to put my knowledge and skills. I included a bit of everything I know and created it in Visual Studio Code. 

I linked an external stylesheet aswell to include some nice touches to it.
